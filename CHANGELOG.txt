This paves the way for offering multiple styles with the module as well as letting others contribute styles. Also 'renamed' themes directory to styles so much moving around of files.

(Theme changes: Themes are now styles and these notes will be called "Style changes" after this. As of this change, you need to set the name of the style on the options page. Advf will look for a directory by that name first in the active theme and then in the module. If you want to customize a style, copy the entire directory into your theme and make changes there.)
