Code cleanup and syncing the branches.

June 6, 2008 - ALPHA 1
------------
#241982 by Michelle: Fixed install function for filling table so it doesn't give warnings and returns success/failure properly. Since it was filling the table even with the warnings, there's no need to rerun this.

#241982 by Michelle with tons of help from litwol and neclimdul: Updated install file to create the new table.
#241982 by Michelle (based on idea from Bdragon): Use a table to store reference to last posts in forum to replace the monster query.

Still to do: Account for deleted/unpublished comments and nodes. Write something in the install file to backfill table with existing posts. More testing.

Theme changes:
advf-forum-submitted.tpl.php - Added an extra section for adding more info when a comment is the latest.
